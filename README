A mission control plugin for Telepathy, integrating with libaccounts and libsignon
to provide IM accounts and authentication. This code is based on Nemo Mobile's
fork of the plugin from Empathy's ubuntu-online-account support.

This code has been updated to not use deprecated methods and adds latest changes
from Empathy's source tree.

qmake is used for build as a convenience. There is no other Qt dependency at present.
